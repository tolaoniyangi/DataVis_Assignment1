        I am a student at Columbia University's <a href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/"> Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP)</a> where I study both <font size = 5 em>Architecture </font> and <font size = 5 em>  Urban Planning</font>. I work as a researcher at the university's <a href="http://buellcenter.org/">Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture </a>, doing architectural research for exhibitions, and an assistant in the Urban Planning program's Urban Analytics concentration, providing technical and administrative support to professors in the concentration.

        I am interested in <STRONG>intersections</STRONG> between architecture and technology, and have dabbled in web design, machine learning and mapping. I am excited to explore more forms of data visualization, and hopefully, I am able to combine my interests in design, planning and technology wherever I end up post-graduation.
