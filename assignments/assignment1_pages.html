          <p class = "bodyText"> The earliest known instance of pie chart usage was over two centuries ago, in 1801, by William Playfair. He published the image below comparing European countries in 'The Statistical Beviary', and we can see from the image that elements of the pie charts we see today are present in the image. In this pie chart, as with modern pie charts, the pie is split into sections and the angle of these sections represents the value of data. </p>  
          <p class = "bodyText"> Pie charts did not become immediately popular, and it was not until 1858 that a French engineer began using the pie chart again. Minard recontextualized the pie chart by using it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart#/media/File:Minard-carte-viande-1858.png"> maps</a> to represent additional information on cattle. </p>

        Pie Chart Disadvantages :  
        

        "Pie charts are primarily used to communicate a part-to-whole relationship
Human visual comprehension is not well-suited to translating the area (let alone volume, in the case of 3D chart) of a pie-slice shape. The exception to this is a case in which the value represented is 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%.
The are demonstrably less effective in communicating information, even part-to-whole relationships, than other charts (bar charts, for example.)
"<br>
Pie charts are supposed to be used to see how a "whole" is segmented in its parts. That's ok when you have two or three categories to visualize. But when you have multiple categories, it becomes hard for the user to identify the proportions correctly, compare different categories and gain any insight from the picture."<br>

        "When you use a pie chart to compare multiple categories it gets hard to label the pieces of the pie. One solution people use is to add color and a legend to the pie chart, but that brings another problem: users get confused when you encode more than certain amount of different colors."
<br>
        Pie charts can mislead users by misrepresenting the actual data in an area that is not proportional. 
        <br>

        Pie charts lead people to compare angles rather than lengths
