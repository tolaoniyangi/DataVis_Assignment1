        I am a a student at Columbia University's <a href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/"> Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP)</a> where I study both Architecture and Urban Planning. I work as a researcher at the university's <a href="http://buellcenter.org/">Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture </a>, doing architectural research for exhibitions, and an assistant in the Urban Planning program's Urban Analytics concentration, providing technical and administrative support to professors in the concentration.

        In the past I've interned as a model shop intern <a href="http://ramsa.com/">Robert A. M. Stern Architects</a>, an architecture intern at <a href="http://www.marblefairbanks.com/">Marble Fairbanks Architects</a> and a teaching assistant at the <a href="http://architecture.barnard.edu/">B+C|A Architecture program</a>.

        I am interested in the intersections between architecture and technology, and have dabbled in web design, machine learning and mapping. I am excited to explore more forms of data visualization, and hopefully, I am able to combine my interests in design, planning and technology wherever I end up post-graduation.
